# Project Title

Develop a loan management system tailored for a single client to handle loan applications, repayments, and overall loan management efficiently. 
This software will allow the client to manage loans without the need for separate user interfaces.

2. Technologies Used
Backend:
Node.js: For server-side JavaScript execution.
Express.js: To create the API.
MongoDB: For database storage of loan records.
Mongoose: For MongoDB object modeling.

Frontend:
HTML/CSS: For the user interface.
JavaScript: For client-side functionality.

- **Repayment Tracking**: Maintain a record of repayments made against loans.
- **Single Client Interface**: Designed specifically for internal use by a single client, eliminating the need for user login or separate interfaces.
- **Secure Authentication**: 
  - **Fingerprint Recognition**: Users can log in securely using fingerprint authentication for quick and safe access to the system.
  - **PIN Entry**: In addition to fingerprint login, users must set and enter a PIN for additional security, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive loan data.
